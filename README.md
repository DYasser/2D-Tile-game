# 2D-Tile-game
First try on a 2D Tile game, created everything without any copyright issue possible.
I create a small world where the player embodies a hero that has to fight versus various monsters.

## Execution:
The program starts with this moving menu screen where there are 3 options, Play, options and exit.

When you click on *Option* you get this screen where you can adjust the brightness and the volume from the game.

And finally here are some visuals of the game:

There are many NPCs in the game that will help the player and direct him towards his goal *save the village*. 
The player has two abilities, **dash** and **attack**. With these two abilities he needs to fight all sorts of monsters and complete his quest.
